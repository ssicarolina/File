% NROOTS:  Find polynomial roots.
%   NROOTS(P) computes all (complex) roots of the polynomial whose 
%   coefficients are the elements of the vector P. If P has N+1 (complex)
%   elements, the polynomial is P(1)*X^N + ... + P(N)*X + P(N+1).
%
%   The algorithm first tries to obtain a good approximation to the 
%   roots by finding eigenvalues of the companion matrix associated with 
%   the polynomial, as per the built-in function ROOTS. The algorithm then
%   uses this first-approximation as input to a simple Newton-Raphson (NR) 
%   iterative scheme, in order to refine (polish) the approximation. Any
%   "root" returned by the NR scheme will be rejected if it differs from
%   the original approximation by more than a specified tolerance (a crude 
%   safegaurd against possible failures of the NR scheme).
%
%   NB: the algorithm's goal is simply to refine the output from ROOTS; in 
%   situations where ROOTS fails to compute one or more roots correctly, 
%   NROOTS will most likely fail similarly. However, NROOTS tends to work
%   well in most non-pathological (e.g. non-repeated roots) cases.
%
%   Class support for input c: 
%      float: double, single
%
%   See also ROOTS, POLY.

%% Newton-Raphson algorithm parameters
% NR_iter is the number of NR iterations used to refine the first
% approximation to a root [default: 5].
NR_iter = 5
% NR_delta is the relative change in the first-approximation to the root
% that must be induced by the NR iteration in order for the NR output to be
% rejected. The idea is to prevent the NR algorithm from converging to a
% nearby but `incorrect' root. For an algorithm that is better suited to
% closely-spaced roots or degenerate roots, see MULTROOT [ACM Transactions 
% on Mathematical Software, Vol. 30, No. 2, June 2004].
